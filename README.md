# jquery-dynamic-inputs
This is a Laravel 10 application that allows users to add and remove multiple input fields dynamically using jQuery. The user can add a new input field by clicking on the "Add More" button, and remove it by clicking on the "Remove" button. The application has a form with a single input field for title and a dynamic input field for message. The messages are added to the form as the user clicks the "Add More" button. The form data is submitted to the server via a POST request and validated using Laravel's built-in validation mechanism. The application is designed and developed by S0S.
